# Smart-Glasses "Solution Challenge 2021"

# Problem Definition :
In our lives there are many people who are suffering from different
diseases or handicaps. Blind people or anyone have vision
difficulties. These people need some help to make their life easier
and better.

# Aim of the Project :
The main goal of "smart glasses" is to help blind people and people
with vision difficulties by introducing a new technology that makes
them able to recognize the environment around them in an easy way.

# We used this technology to build our Solution
# a. Object Detection: 
by using TensorFlow v2 and Yolo Algorithm
That detects and defines objects such as humans, buildings and cars
from digital images.
# b. OCR: 
The task is to scan any text image and convert it into audio
text, so the person will listen to the audio through a headphone that’s
connected to the glasses.
# c. Face Recognition: 
to recognize the people he may be know.
# d. Speech Recognition: 
In order for the glasses to recognize the
voice of a blind person and perform the required task.

# Finally
We Connect project final test and debugging.

# We are using
Raspberry Pi, Camera, Power bank, Mic and wires.

# We hope in the future
that we will work on developing this
solution and add new features such as that the blind person who
wears glasses if he is in a place he does not know, can share his
location with the closest people to him through an application on his
mobile that is connected to the smart glasses in order to come to him
in the shortest time.
